# v-HestiaCP-Nginx-Proxy-LAN
This is a collection of configs to use with HestiaCP for running inside your LAN behind Nat to access internal apps on one or more servers. Uses Hestia's lets encrypt to supply SSL.  Secure internal browsing of web GUIs or external access by IP, VPN or Mod Auth. Just getting this repo put together. Would love some communal help. Please join in sharing your LAN configs for HestiaCP. Help with readmes, commenting instructions, or other improvements.

--Starting .tpl
ApacheTPL: A blank template for Apache, Since routing to another server you don't need it.

----Nginx
EdgeRouter: Works on ERX, should on others.
--Local access: Local access only template, Allows lets encrypt and local subnets but blocks internet.
--Secure Access: Local access + Password for public access. (Commiting to repo soon)
